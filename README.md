# triangular solitare
A (shit) JavaScript recreation of a game I did't know the name of, now i do, it's triangular solitare/triangular peg solitare/peg game/triangular solo noble etc.
 
It spews out an error on every move, I don't know why, the code is unreadable, it is ugly itself, it was made a long time ago, other stuff
